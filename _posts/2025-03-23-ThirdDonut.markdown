### My Third Donut!!!

Welp, it happened again.

[I mentioned in a previous post](/FAQs/hotpicks/) that I have had two stock trades that resulted in a total and complete loss.  Well, I now have my third.  

Of course, I'm *not* considering the multitude of trades in options contracts that became worthless upon expiration.  I consider that a separate issue with different dynamics that play into it...  namely, that an equity position doesn't "expire".  

But I want to highlight a couple of things about this trade that bear mentioning.  

Firstly, it was not a ruinous trade.  I had only allocated about 1.5% of my total portfolio value to this trade.  Worst case senario?  Not palatable, but easily digestible.  

Secondly, I had a chance to exit.  Not just exit, but exit with a profit.  Not just a profit, but a nice +60% profit...  and I elected to hold on instead.  And now all I'm holding is a bag of inedible donuts.

(Shrug)  

It happens, folks.  Fortunately it's not a regular occurrence, but it's still someting to factor into your money management/allocation strategy!!!

Caveat Emptor.
